# Bus-Ticket-Booking-System

**INTRODUCTION **

**Purpose **

If the entire process of reservation is done in a manual manner then it would take several months for reservation to reach the applicant. Considering the fact that the number of passengers is increasing every year, an Automated System becomes essential to meet the demand. So this system uses several programming and database techniques to elucidate the work involved in this process. As this is a matter of National Security, the system has been carefully verified and validated in order to satisfy it. 

**Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions **

Any person who is willing to book tickets.


**Project Scope**

The System provides an online interface to the user where they can fill in their personal details and submit the necessary documents (maybe by scanning). The authority concerned with the issue of railway can use this system to reduce his workload and process the application in a speedy manner. Provide a communication platform between the passenger and the administrator. Passengers will come to know their status of application and the date in which they must subject themselves for manual document verification.
